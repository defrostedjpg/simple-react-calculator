## Lessons Learned

I learned how to fix the dreaded fixed floating number precision when dealing with Javascript - By using [Decimal.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/decimal.js/v/3.0.0).

I also learned how to reduce clutter in the code, by avoiding If statements when possible. I know my code may still look messy, but everyone starts somewhere.
